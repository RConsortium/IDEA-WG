Version: 1.1

This is a template code of conduct that event organizers can use for conferences, meetups, and other events. You'll need to replace the `<EVENT>`, `<RESPONSE TEAM>`, and `<EMAIL ADDRESS>`placeholders with information specific to your event.

# Code of Conduct

RConsortium events are community events intended for networking and collaboration in the R community. We value the participation of each member and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout all events hosted in the virtual or in-person space.

To make clear what is expected, all attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers, and volunteers at any event in the RConsortium-affiliated space are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.

`<EVENT>` is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for participants at RConsortium event(s). `<EVENT>` is a conference intended for professional networking and collaboration in the R community.

We encourage the open exchange of ideas and expression and thus require an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group. An inclusive space free of harassment encourages interaction among diverse groups. We want to make certain `<EVENT>` is welcoming, and encourages participants to be involved moving forward.

A Code of Conduct (CoC) is useful to define accepted and acceptable behaviors and to promote high standards of professional practice. It also provides a benchmark for self evaluation and acts as a vehicle for better identity of the community and organization. If you have general questions about codes of conduct, a good place to start is this [code of conduct FAQ](https://www.ashedryden.com/blog/codes-of-conduct-101-faq#cocfaq).

This Code of Conduct applies to any participant at `<EVENT>`, including participants in meetings and teleconferences, vendors, staff, and volunteers. This CoC generally applies to conference and pre-conference events. Note that this code augments rather than replaces legal rights and obligations pertaining to any particular situation.

## Commitment to Diversity

The RConsortium supports the [Diversity Charter](http://diversitycharter.org/) for technology events. We want our events and the events we attend to both reflect and encourage the diversity of the R community. 

The RConsortium is committed to providing opportunities for all people regardless of race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, age, abilities, wealth, and language, to participate in R events in a safe environment. We welcome all who come to learn and enjoy the experience without prejudice and ask attendees to help us make the conference a fantastic time for everyone.

## Expected Behavior

All event participants are expected to behave in accordance with professional standards, with both this Code of Conduct as well as their respective employer's policies governing appropriate workplace behavior, and all applicable laws.

We’re committed to providing welcome environments where people behave according to professional standards. We expect everyone at any RConsortium-affiliated event to contribute to a welcoming, civil, safe, and tolerant environment.

Examples of encouraged behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for everyone at the event
- Showing empathy towards other participants

## Unacceptable Behavior

Harassment will not be tolerated in any form, including but not limited to:
- Intimidation or harassment of any kind.
- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or any other status protected by laws in which the conference or program is being held.
- Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
- Deliberate misgendering, “outing,” or use of "dead" or rejected names.
- Gratuitous or off-topic blatant sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they're not appropriate.
- Not respecting the privacy of other participants 

### Harassment in online channels

Participants at `<EVENT>` may also participate online (see below). Please use these guidelines where engaging with participants. The above Code of Conduct still applies to online events, with the addition of:

- Avoid using overtly sexual or offensive usernames or profile photos which might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
- Do not publish text/screenshots of anything shared in private communication channels without explicit consent from the author. This includes screenshots of private messages to public channels, as well as conversations on public channels to anywhere outside of `<EVENT>` Slack.
- Do not direct message someone without their permission. 
- Do not record sessions without the presenter’s permission.
- The meeting host/organizer should be aware of privacy concerns for different tools. For tips on security, a good place to start is: [Securing Your Zoom Meetings](https://zoom.us/docs/doc/Securing%20Your%20Zoom%20Meetings.pdf)

This CoC applies to the all `<EVENT>` online spaces (e.g. Twitter, Slack, Facebook, WhatsApp, Gitter, LinkedIn, Telegram, Zoom). 

## What To Do If You Witness or Are Subject To Unacceptable Behavior

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns relating to harassment, please contact a member of event staff immediately. Event staff can be identified by t-shirts/staff badges onsite; and an organizer can be found at the event registration counter at any time. You can contact the `<RESPONSE TEAM>` at `<EMAIL ADDRESS (+ optional PHONE)>`.

While this code of conduct applies to spaces associated with `<EVENT>`, if you are being harassed by a guest/participant of/at `<EVENT>` outside of our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by `<EVENT>` participants seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The `<EVENT>` organizing committee reserves the right to exclude people from `<EVENT>` based on their past behavior, including behavior outside `<EVENT>` spaces and behavior towards people who are not part of `<EVENT>`.

If you witness or are subject to harassing behavior online, please include screenshots of the behavior, if possible, in your report.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

Conference staff will also provide support to victims, including, but not limited to:

- Providing an escort
- Contacting hotel/venue security or local law enforcement
- Briefing key event staff for response/victim assistance
- And otherwise assisting those experiencing harassment to ensure that they feel safe for the duration of the conference.

### Consequences

If a participant engages in behavior in violation of the CoC, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, ranging from issuing a warning to expulsion from the conference with no refund, depending on the circumstances. `<EVENT>` reserves the right to exclude any participant found to be engaging in harassing behavior from participating in any further `<EVENT>` events, trainings or other activities.

## Pre-Event Concerns

If you are planning to attend an upcoming event, and have concerns regarding another individual who may be present, please contact `<RESPONSE TEAM>` at `<EMAIL ADDRESS (+ optional PHONE)>`. Precautions will be taken to ensure a victim's comfort and safety, including, but not limited to: providing an escort, prepping onsite event staff, keeping victim and harasser from attending the same talks/social events, and providing onsite contact cell phone numbers for immediate contact.  In extreme cases, we may take action to prevent the harasser from attending the conference.
