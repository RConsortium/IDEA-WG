# Code of Conduct

`<EVENT>` is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for participants at our event(s). `<EVENT>` is a working conference intended for professional networking and collaboration in the R community. They exist to encourage the open exchange of ideas and expression and require an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group. 

A **Code of Conduct** is useful to define accepted and acceptable behaviors and to promote high standards of professional practice. It also provides a benchmark for self evaluation and acts as a vehicle for better identity of the community and organization.

This code (**CoC**) applies to any participant at `<EVENT>` – developers, participants in meetings, teleconferences, mailing lists, conferences or functions, etc. Note that this code complements rather than replaces legal rights and obligations pertaining to any particular situation.

## Expected Behavior

All event participants are expected to behave in accordance with professional standards, with both this Code of Conduct as well as their respective employer’s policies governing appropriate workplace behavior, and applicable laws.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Harassment will not be tolerated in any form, including but not limited to:

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or any other status protected by laws in which the conference or program is being held.
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
* Deliberate misgendering or use of 'dead' or rejected names.

## What To Do If You Witness or Are Subject To Unacceptable Behavior

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns relating to harassment, please contact a member of event staff immediately. Event staff can be identified by t-shirts/staff badges onsite; and an organizer can be found at the event registration counter at any time. You can contact the `<RESPONSE TEAM>` via `<CONTACT INFO>`.

While this code of conduct applies to `<EVENT>` spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member/guest/participant of/at `<EVENT>` outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by `<EVENT>` members, especially the organizing team, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The organizing team reserves the right to exclude people from `<EVENT>` based on their past behavior, including behavior outside `<EVENT>` spaces and behavior towards people who are not part of `<EVENT>`.

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of `<EVENT>` members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

Conference staff will also provide support to victims, including, but not limited to:

- Providing an escort
- Contacting hotel/venue security or local law enforcement
- Briefing key event staff to for response/victim assistance
- And otherwise assisting those experiencing harassment to ensure that they feel safe for the duration of the conference.

### Consequences

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, ranging from issuance of a warning to the offending individual to expulsion from the conference with no refund, depending on the circumstances. `<EVENT>` reserves the right to exclude any participant found to be engaging in harassing behavior from participating in any further `<EVENT>` events, trainings or other activities.

## Pre-Event Concerns

If you are planning to attend an upcoming event, and have concerns regarding another individual who may be present, please contact `<RESPONSE TEAM>` via `<CONTACT INFO>`. Precautions will be taken to ensure a victim’s comfort and safety, including, but not limited to: providing an escort, prepping onsite event staff, keeping victim and harasser from attending the same talks/social events and providing onsite contact cell phone numbers for immediate contact.
