# README

This folder contains a code of conduct (CoC) that event organizers in the R
community can use. This CoC was adapted from the
[R-Ladies Code of Conduct](https://rladies.org/code-of-conduct/) and the [Linux Foundation Code of Conduct](https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/code-of-conduct/). 
If you plan to use this CoC for your event, fill in your contact details and any
other event-specific information. 

This CoC is a collaborative effort of the R Consortium Diversity and Inclusion
Working group and has undergone review from working group members as well as
legal counsel. The document covers many details that the working group considers
important in a code of conduct, but not every detail may be right for every
event. Organizers should take care to ensure that the CoC reflects the values
and behaviors they are prepared to enforce, and should consult with their own
legal counsel over any questions or concerns.

For more guidance on codes of conduct and enforcement, see the
[resources](resources.md) we've gathered.
