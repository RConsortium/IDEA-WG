# README

This folder contains a draft code of conduct (CoC) that event organizers in the R
community can use. This CoC was adapted from the
[R-Ladies Code of Conduct](https://rladies.org/code-of-conduct/). 
If you plan to use this CoC for your event, fill in your contact details and any
other event-specific information. 

The document covers many details that the working group considers important in a
code of conduct, but not every detail may be right for every event. So
organizers should still take care to ensure that the CoC reflects the values and
behaviors they are prepared to enforce.
