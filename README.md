# R Community Diversity and Inclusion Working Group

## Goal
The goal of the R Community Diversity and Inclusion Working Group (RCDI-WG) is to broadly consider how the R Consortium can best encourage and support diverse and inclusion across a variety of events and platforms. The short-term priority is to define and publicise on best practices for R community events, and ensure that events funded by the R consortium adhere to those guidelines. In the long term, the RCDI-WG will think about how diversity and inclusion can be woven throughout all R Consortium activities. 

## How to Join
Any interested R community member is encouraged to participate. We meet on the first Monday of every month via Zoom from 7:00pm to 8:00pm (GMT+00:00) UTC.
