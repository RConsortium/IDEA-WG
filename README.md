# R Community Inclusion, Diversity, Equality, & Accesibility (IDEA)

## Goal
The R-Community IDEA is a top level project of the R-Consortium with the goal of broadly considering how the R Consortium can best encourage and support diverse and inclusion across a variety of events and platforms. 

## How to Join
Any interested R community member is encouraged to participate. We meet on the first Monday of every month via Zoom from 7:00pm to 8:00pm (GMT+00:00) UTC.
