### Organization of the Revised Code of Conduct for Events

(https://github.com/RConsortium/RCDI-WG/blob/master/conduct/code-of-conduct.md; Led by Joe Rickert, Gabriela de Quieroz, and Samantha Toet)

Original group has tied up loose ends. Looking for new members to help organize, share, promote, and discuss enforcement. 

Next steps:

Discussion about summarization (similarly to Carpentries CoC https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html), distribution, and enforcement (possibly in organizer‚Äôs checklist?). 

Joe and Samantha working on opening statement about commitment to diversity and subsequent categorization.
How can we share it with more of the community? We‚Äôll start with social media, and Sam will send drafts and select date. 

### Conference Best Practices Checklist/Badges

(https://github.com/RConsortium/RCDI-WG/blob/master/outputs/conferencebestpractices.md, Led by Samantha Toet & Noa Tamir)

Added entries from NumFocus cookbook and created Google Sheet listing and categorizing all items: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CLRbwqNAEvG8-yeoM0AJsBqXU7Lot3jGFPtNz7zUfYU/edit?usp=sharing. 

Soliciting feedback on items and subsequent categorization and organization.

Next steps: 

Everyone to list the top 5 ‚Äúmust have‚Äù items

Think about what resources are needed for each item: knowledge, funds, time

Brainstorm sponsor buy-in (expand to include sponsors, sponsorship discounts for meeting criteria, sponsorship of access, vision, etc.). Reorganize sponsor categories to support needs

Proposing new dates for in-meeting interviews. March or April 2020. Keeping format previously discussed: 20 minute conversations, with 15 minutes between organizer and moderator, then 5 minutes conversation / questions from everyone.

New ideas seen at conferences: first time speaker track at PyCon Limerick Ireland

### R in Africa

(Led by Shelmith Kariuki, Dennis Irorere)

Update on local R user groups:

Many organisers struggling to find venues. 

Shelmith and Dennis busy helping organisers apply for R consortium funding

Update on conferences:

Saturdays Nairobi planned for November.

Talks on having ARUM 2020 / 2021 are underway. 

Remote lightning talks? ERUM for time zones? Pre-recorded? 

Planning to reach out to DSA (Data Science Africa to get to hear how they organise the event)

### Participant Diversity Visa Support

(Led by Kevin O‚ÄôBrien, Richard Ngamita)

How can organizers support difficult travel and Visa needs for international participants and diversity scholars? 

Suggestions: extend timeline, work with participants on an individual need-by-need basis, work with embassies, provide more verified information and documentation. 

Look at Visa situation in African regions (East, West). Break out into separate countries? US and EU.

Looking for additional participants to help out with this.
