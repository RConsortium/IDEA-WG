    + Updates from Mishi Choudhari (lawyer with CoC expertise) — PR of suggested changes: https://github.com/RConsortium/RCDI-WG/pull/17 (mostly minor clarifications).
    + Looking for help drafting other CoC changes, incl. lead in paragraph

    + Call with Open API folks about their CoC development. Focus on enforcement as that’s the hardest part.
    + Jacqueline Serafin to ask around inside the LF - updates?

    + Sam reached out to previous subcommittee members and is pulling everything together into one PR
    + Next step: merge PR and start categorization
    + How can we incentivise organizers to want to check off more boxes? Maybe we can give badges that they can post on their conference webpages (gold, silver, and bronze?)

    + Working towards inviting conference organizers to share their experiences recruiting diverse speakers, at this meeting:

        + Talked with CSVonf to answer questions about the planned conversations. Will be setting up similar meetings with PyCon and Deep Learning Indaba.
        + Next steps:
                + Identify future RCDI meeting where we can invite first set of conference organizers (CSVconf?). Conversation will last about 20 minutes. Proposal: August 5 with csv,conf
                + Generate list of questions to ask conference organizers
    + Angela: short talks help get people to submit more proposals with a low barrier of entry, personalized reach outs are helpful
        + Structure event so that you pair newer presenters with more senior speakers or mentors
