* Code of conduct review/training (Audrey Eschright)
    + Youtube: https://youtu.be/nizfHxg8y3o 
    + $275 for review + 30 minute call with the group — HW to engage Audrey for review.
    + $40-$100 / person: three-week online workshop for code of conduct enforcement
        + Could we cover the cost?
        + Review existing code of conduct: meeting existing standards or open to edit. But don’t want to become code of conduct police. Should have at least a minimal set of criteria: 3 element checklist (specific prohibited behaviours, discusses outcomes of violation, and process for reporting violation) 
        + Could it be a reward for following (some of?) our guidelines?
        + Community conferences only? Smaller budgets?
        + When would we review? Monthly on call? via email?
        + HW — will introduce KW to AE via email.
        + KW will lead effort to come up with a proposal for how this program will work, will report back next month
        
* Next meeting:

* Ongoing Discussions: 
    + Code of conduct desired features (discussion lead by KW)
        + Important to have explicit list of behaviours that are not permitted; makes it much harder for people to push the boundaries
            + Sends strong signal to attendees that organisers understand the potential risks
        + Clear instructions for reporting violations
            + How will reports will be handled? What are possible sanctions? 
            + How much information is needed? i.e. what happens if you don’t know the person’s name? Collect as much information as possible? Reach out to other possible witnesses?
        + How will enforcement be handled?
            + What will organisers do with reports?  How will privacy be respected?
        + How do you train people to handle?

    + Discuss R consortium Code of Conduct generally — how do we enforce it?
    + How are we defining diversity? How do we measure it? Do we want to be able to? Should we be recording/analysing?
    + What happens if a conference agrees to our principles, and then fails to live up to them?
    + How do we tackle diversity & inclusion in our online spaces? What can community organisers do to promote diverse & enjoyable online spaces?
